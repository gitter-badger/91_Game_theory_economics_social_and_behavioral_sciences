\begin{document}
Utility is taken to be an absolute, accurate measurement of how desirable something is; in particular, it differs from money in three key ways.

First, desire for it is linear (generally in economics and game \PMlinkescapetext{theory} a person with a lot of money receives less utility from an additional \PMlinkescapetext{fixed} amount of money than someone with very little money).

Second, when modeling a \PMlinkescapetext{real} situation, utility should include all external \PMlinkescapetext{factors} (the happiness received from doing a good deed, for instance).

Third, different people's utility is incomparable.  It is meaningless to ask whether one person gets more utility from a situation than another person does.  Utilities for a given person can be compared only to other utilities for that person.

A utility function is a function which specifies how much utility a player gets for a particular outcome.  It maps the space $S$ of all possible strategy profiles to $\mathbb{R}$.
