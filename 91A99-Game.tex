In general, a \emph{game} is a way of describing a situation in which \emph{players} make choices with the intent of optimizing their \emph{utility}.  Formally, a game includes three features:
\begin{itemize}

\item a set of pure strategies for each player (their strategy space)

\item a way of determining an \emph{outcome} from the strategies selected by the players

\item a utility function for each player specifying their \emph{payoff} for each outcome

\end{itemize}
